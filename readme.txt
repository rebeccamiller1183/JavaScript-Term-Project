TANK DECORATION
Purpose/instructions: User is able to drag and drop different elements into the fish tank to decorate it how they like
Issues and fixes: To see all decorating options, you have to scroll down the page which is a bit annoying. This could be fixed by adjusting the styling of the page so that they display next to the tank as well as underneath. 


DIVING GAME
Purpose/instructions: Use the direction buttons to move the diver gamepiece around the canvas, avoiding obstacles
Issues: Not an issue really, but to improve the button keys on a keyboard could be used to move the diver as well
Plans to resolve: Add coding so that the arrow keys have the same functionality as the buttons

CLAM ROULETTE
Purpose/instructions: Try to select a (randomly assigned) clam with a pearl inside by clicking the respective buttons
Issues: Two main things could be improved in this game- one is that the images themselves could be used to select instead of buttons, and the other is that 
the use of the arrow button is a bit clunky
Plans to resolve: Revise code to make images function the way the numbered buttons do, possibly update so that the contents of the clams are revealed, then a few moments later they are switched to closed again
